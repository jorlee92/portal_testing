Brandon Larkin - Been in IT since 2004, current a K-12 IT Director after 10 years in higher education.  Coming back to code after a long time away and refreshing.  Love building things so hoping this scratches that itch and I can make a career pivot.  Currently have more experience in front end while still learning more back end and DevOps.
